<div class="paragraph"><p>Nepal Tourism Board is a national tourism organization of Nepal established in 1998 by an Act of Parliament in the form of partnership between the Government of Nepal and private sector tourism industry  to develop and market Nepal as an attractive tourist destination. The Board provides platform for vision-drawn leadership for Nepal’s tourism sector by integrating Government commitment with the dynamism of private sector.<br>
<br>
NTB is promoting Nepal in the domestic and international market and is working toward positioning the image of the country. It also aims to regulate product development activities. Fund for NTB is collected in the form of Tourist Service Fee from departing foreign passengers at the Tribhuvan International Airport, Kathmandu, thus keeping it financially independent.

<div class="description1"><h1><u>Our Mission</u></h1></div>

<div class="goal"><p>Tourism has become one of the main income sources for many developing countries like Nepal. Nepal has great potential to become a top destination for tourists as the nation is famous for its snowcapped mountains, abundant flora and fauna, exciting trekking routes and rich cultural and religious diversity.<br>
<br>
According to Lonely Planet, Kathmandu is the 5th top travel destination while tripadvisor.com has ranked Kathmandu at 19th out of 25 best tourism destinations in the world for the year 2019. These facts reveal that there are many places like Kathmandu that could fascinate tourists from around the world.According to the WTTC, the share of the travel and tourism sector in India’s GDP is about 10 per cent. It is about 5 per cent in Nepal.<br>
<br>
Spain maintains first place globally in the global travel and tourism competitiveness index. The 2017 report covers 136 economies, of which China ranks 15th, India 40th and Nepal 103rd in global rankings.
Nepal holds great potential for tourism development, which can stimulate economic growth and development. For Nepal, tourism is the main instrument for regional development with positive economic impact on the income, employment and production.<br>
<br>
In recent years, there has been exponential growth in the number of travel agencies, tour guides, tour operators, rafting agencies and trekking agencies. In 2018, the number of registered travel agencies reached up to 3,508 and trekking agencies 2,649. However, tourism may also have a negative impact on the environment. For sustainable tourism development, there should be optimum utilisation of natural resources and minimisation of ecological, cultural and social impacts. Additionally, there is a need for conducive policies and strategies by the government that will help improve the livelihood of the local communities through balanced and sectoral tourism development.</p></div>
